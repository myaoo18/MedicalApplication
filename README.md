# MedicalApplication by Mandy Yao (EC 530)
## Description
The goal of this project is to create a medical application API to help monitor patients at home or in the hospital and faciliate communication between patient and medical professional through device module and chat module. The users of this application include patients, medical professionals, administrators and developers.  


## Database Module
The goal of the datebase module is to provide an API that accepts data in json format, validates the input, and transfers it to a database.

## Chat System Module
The goal of the chat system module is to validate message packages, store them in mongoDB, allow users to find messages based on id and names, delete message packages from mongoDB and return a count of existing packages from the database. This API allows users to connect to a backend communication plateform that mimics that of a real-time chat functionality.
